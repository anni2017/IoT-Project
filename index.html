        IoT CoE was established on August 26, 2023. Students from various branches were selected to ensure diversity. To achieve this, a pre-test was organized, and the chosen students underwent two interviews assessing their knowledge of electronics and coding. The selected students became part of the IoT CoE teams based on their skills and expertise.
